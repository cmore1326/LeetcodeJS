# LeetcodeJS
A collection of Javascript LeetCode questions, and my solutions. Each .js file are meant to be run independently. If you'd like to run each .js file, in the terminal, then change directory to whereever you saved the .js files. Insure you have Node.js installed. Then, in the terminal, type "node filename.js". All output will be sent to the terminal.
